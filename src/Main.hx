I started working on that in version 0.29, so if you're looking for a playable version you'll have to go back to v0.28 (which you can still find on my furAffinity page). Hopefully I'll have this new engine in a working state soon. Until then, please stick around!</p>");

If I can get it in the game I'll do so and let you know (and yes you will be credited with writing it in game.) You can also write characters if you'd like, more information, including what slots are open, can be found on the forums.</p>");
